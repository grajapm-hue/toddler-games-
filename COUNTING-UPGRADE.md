# SaNa Little Hands Beta v1.18

The published Beta is `docs/beta/`. The v1.17 release was uploaded directly there;
the older root prototype and `beta-runtime/` build inputs have not caught up.
This upgrade therefore edits the current published source without regenerating it
from those older inputs. Running `build-beta.mjs` would replace newer features.

## Counting changes

- Age 2 keeps the counted apples in the basket; Age 3 keeps the carrots beside the rabbit.
- On reaching the requested count, SaNa says **Well done! Wait for the next count.**
- The collection and its completed numeral remain visible for 3,000 milliseconds.
  Further drops and Demo are paused. The current thumbnail stays unticked.
- After that pause, the thumbnail ticks and the next count begins. The last
  collection stays visible until Again, rather than restarting automatically.
- The selected source item is removed exactly once. Again, Games, age changes,
  and game navigation cancel the pending transition.

The counting illustrations are separate transparent assets generated with the
built-in image generator. No fruit is baked into the tree, soil, basket, or rabbit,
so the visible collection always agrees with the counter. Assets and the exact
generation prompts are in [docs/beta/count-art](docs/beta/count-art/generation.json).

The install manifest, other games' artwork, and the Age 5 abacus remain unchanged.
The Beta worker precaches the six illustrations and the exact versioned game script.

## Verification

Run `node check-count-adventures.cjs` with Playwright's test module available.
`MM_PLAYWRIGHT` may point to an existing installation, and `MM_CHROME` may select
an installed Chromium executable. `PLAYROOM_BROWSER=webkit` selects WebKit.
`COUNT_URL` can target the published Beta; otherwise a local server serves `docs/`.
`COUNT_EVIDENCE` selects the evidence directory.

Checks cover every Age 2 and Age 3 count, the full three-second hold, delayed ticks,
extra/invalid/canceled drops, reset and age navigation, phone/tablet/desktop and
rotated touch input, immersive praise, Age 4/5 and Slide/Paint smoke flows, and
offline images/play. WebKit's local offline check stops the real local origin;
Chromium uses offline network emulation. Browser checks do not certify a physical
device installation.
